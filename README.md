Android House Inspection Report App

Core Flow
• Start a new inspection, entering basic property information and client name once.
• For each error found, the app will allow you to take one or more photos on the spot, then enter a brief description.
• When you hit “Done,” the app automatically merges everything into the existing .docx template—preserving styling, headings, tables, and page breaks—and saves a Word document to your device that you can email or open in MS Word.

Essential Features
– Android-only build.
– Take photos directly from the app, with images embedded in the final document.
– Text fields are mapped to placeholders in the template.
– Local storage; the app should work completely offline when you’re in the basement and have no signal.
